Basic recursion: 

1. We have to follow the two essential things
    i. Base Case 
    ii. Return proper value to continue the recursion

Helper Method recursion
We have an outer function which supplies the parameters or the variable values.
using which we can declare an inner recursion function which then uses the outside declared variables 
and at the end returns the result.

Ex: collectOddValues program (Helper method approach refer in problem set 1)

PURE RECURSION TIPS:
1. For arrays, use methods like slice, the spread operator, and concat that make copies of arrays so you do not mutate them.
2. Remember that strings are immutable so you will need to use methods like slice, substr, or substring to make copies of strings.
3.To make copies of objects use Object.assign, or the spread operator.
