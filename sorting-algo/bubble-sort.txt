Bubble Sort?
It is a way of sorting the elements of an array by comparing the sibling element 
i.e if el1 > el2 , swap them and continue to all the elements of an array, where for each iteration 
over an array the largest item will get the last position

[2,1,0]
    [1,2,0]
        [1,0,2] -> 1st iteration
            [0,1,2] -> it will loop through ignoring the last value as it is the greatest (it is ignored)
