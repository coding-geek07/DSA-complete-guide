1.What is an Algorithm?
Ans: An algorithm is basically a series of steps or process to solve a task.

2.How do you improve problem solving skills?
Ans: we can follow a two step process 
i. Devise a plan to solve problems
ii. Master common problem solving patterns

3.Problem solving strategies?
Ans: We can follow the below steps in order to approach a problem to solve
step 1: UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM
-> Questions you need to ask yourself or interviewer inorder to understand the problem completely.
i.Can I restate the problem in my own words?
ii.What are the inputs that go into the problem?
iii.What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
iv.Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
v.How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

->Example: Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum.
i.Can I restate the problem in my own words?
Ask: Is it like implementing an addition. correct?

ii.What are the inputs that go into the problem?
Ask: Are my inputs 
        - Integer alone
        - Floats
        - what about strings or big numbers?
        - Is there any restriction that function should allow only two numbers?

iii.What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
Ask: what type of outputs are expected?
        - Int? float? strings? or anything is fine?

iv.Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
Ask: Do i have all the information required in implementing the logic or do i need to have any other values? For ex you can ask
        - what if the user passes only one number?
        - if the number is not provided should we return undefined or null or etc.,
        - should i add 0 to perform the operation?

v.How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
Ask: Are there any specific terms you want me to use for the data like
     - function name should be add()?
     - params name should be num1, num2?
     - should i display it as sum when the result is returned?

step 2: Explore concrete examples


step 3: Break it down


step 4: Solve / Simplify


step 5: Look back and refactor
