1.What is BIG O Notation and why we have to use this?
Big O Notation is a way of telling the code quality by calculating the time or space it takes.
For example : It is like Grading a particular program which we write, like
Great
Better
Good
Awful
Worst
but interms of the time it takes and space it consumes. As a problem might have multiple solutions,
BIG O Notation will help us in understanding which works best.
