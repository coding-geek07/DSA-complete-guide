1.What is Divide and Conquer Pattern?
Ans: This pattern involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with a subset of data.

This pattern can tremendously decrease time complexity

Example:
Index Search
Given a sorted array of integers, write a function called search, that accepts a value and returns the index where the value passed to the function is located. If the value is not found, return -1

search([1,2,3,4,5,6],4) // 3
search([1,2,3,4,5,6],6) // 5
search([1,2,3,4,5,6],11) // -1
