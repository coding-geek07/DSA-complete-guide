Insertion Sort
Builds up the items, by taking an item and placing it in the appropriate index checking if it is less than the next item and greater than previous item.

[ 5, 3, 4, 1, 2 ] // it will place before 5
     ^ 
[ 3, 5, 4, 1, 2 ] // checks if it is greater than 3 and less than 5, if it is, then it is shifted before 5
        ^
[ 3, 4, 5, 1, 2 ] // repeat it for the rest of the items
[ 1, 3, 4, 5, 2 ]
[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
